# DPRMS – Digital Patient Record Management System

One tap. A lifetime of medical history — finally in your hands

## 🩺 What is DPRMS?

DPRMS is a digital health infrastructure platform designed for:
- ✅ Patients in rural or underserved areas
- ✅ Doctors and small clinics who lack medical record systems

**Why This Problem?**

"In India and Bangladesh, the healthcare crisis isn’t just about lack of doctors — it’s about broken information systems across every level of care."

**For Patients:** Most patients, especially in rural and semi-urban areas, receive treatment without ever having a permanent medical history. They carry paper prescriptions (often torn or unreadable), lose test results, and switch clinics with no data trail. Many face repeated tests and even fatal errors because of unavailable records.

**For Doctors:** Primary care physicians work with incomplete data, making decisions based on guesswork. Many can’t retrieve old prescriptions or lab reports. There’s no real-time access to patient timelines or alerts for interactions and history — causing risk in both diagnosis and treatment.

## 💡 Why We Built This

In many parts of South Asia, patients carry torn paper prescriptions, and doctors are left guessing. After a personal medical emergency in my family, I realized how broken the current system is — especially for the poor.

🧪 What We’ve Built So Far

- A high-fidelity **user interface prototype** built to test user flows for doctors and patients  
- A **QR-based medical summary mockup** to simulate scan-and-access workflows  
- Early tests using **Supabase** for secure storage and authentication  
- An **AI-powered summarisation concept** for converting uploaded reports into a structured health timeline  
- A **growing waitlist** from our outreach to real-world users and healthcare workers

📌 Note: This is a UI-first MVP. We’ve validated user experience and are now actively looking for a **technical co-founder** to help bring the backend and AI infrastructure to life. If you're passionate about fixing healthcare and building in the open — let’s connect.

## 🧭 Roadmap
- [ ] Private beta for patients & doctors
- [ ] Secure data sharing protocol
- [ ] Pilot with 5 small clinics
- [ ] Launch in Bangladesh & India
